## About AfriLinguaDAO
AfriLinguaDAO is a pan-African, community-governed initiative that builds ethically sourced, multimodal datasets (text, audio, video, visual culture) for African languages. We develop and publish responsibly trained language & speech models, track provenance on-chain, and return value to contributors via the **$AFRI** token and DAO governance.

We combine:
- community-led data collection (ambassadors, validators),
- open-source ingestion & training pipelines,
- decentralized provenance (IPFS / Arweave + Solana),
- and tokenized, transparent benefit-sharing.

## Our mission
Preserve African languages and cultural knowledge at scale — ethically, transparently, and with value returned to the communities who keep these languages alive.

---

## What we build
- Reproducible, documented pipelines for collecting text/audio/video.  
- Transcription and translation tooling (Whisper / wav2vec2 integration).  
- Multilingual datasets with on-chain provenance and per-item licenses.  
- Fine-tuned ASR, MT, and language models optimized for African languages.  
- A marketplace + DAO for licensing, research access and community grants.

## Why this matters
As AI increasingly shapes knowledge and culture, under-represented languages risk being overwritten by synthetic, English-centric content. AfriLinguaDAO ensures African languages are preserved, accurately modeled, and that communities share in the value they create.

## How to get involved

### 1) Contribute code
1. Find a repo above → fork it → create a branch `feat/your-feature`.  
2. Implement & test your change. Add tests under `tests/`.  
3. Open a Pull Request with a clear description and sample outputs.
- Suggested first issues: add a scraper for a language, improve transcription pipeline, add unit tests.

**Sample clone**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AfriLinguaDAO/afrilingua-webscraper.git
cd afrilingua-webscraper
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

### 2) Contribute data (recordings, text, media)

* Read `DATA_LICENSES.md` in the relevant repo before uploading.
* Only submit content you have rights to share or where consent is recorded.
* Use the ingestion app / `src/ingest` helper to attach the required metadata (language, dialect, location, consent_hash, license).

### 3) Become an Ambassador

Ambassadors lead local onboarding, validation and outreach in their country/region. Apply: `<YOUR_AMBASSADOR_FORM_URL>`
Ambassador responsibilities:

* run recording days, validate contributions, and support community consent & quality.

### 4) Sponsor or partner

We welcome partnerships (research grants, radio partners, universities). Email: `partnerships@afrilingua.org` (placeholder).

## Data & Ethics (short)

* **Consent-first**: all community-sourced content must have informed consent recorded in local language; consent hashes are stored alongside metadata.
* **Licensing**: datasets are released per dataset license (community/default: CC-BY-SA; commercial: negotiated). See `DATA_LICENSES.md`.
* **Cultural safeguards**: Ambassadors & review boards can classify content as restricted/sacred and manage access.

---

## Governance & $AFRI token

* AfriLinguaDAO governance includes Ambassadors, Validators, and token holders.
* $AFRI (SPL on Solana) powers contributor rewards, staking for governance weight, and the marketplace.
* Sensitive cultural decisions use anti-capture mechanisms (quadratic voting + reputation weighting).
* Learn more in the governance docs: `<YOUR_DOCS_URL>/governance`

* **Phase 3 (Scale)** — DAO voting, 54-country onboarding, marketplace beta (2027)
* **Phase 4 (Ecosystem)** — Grants, education programs, enterprise partnerships (2028+)

## A note to partners & contributors

We are building more than datasets — we are building trust. If you work with AfriLinguaDAO, expect transparent reporting, community-first contracts, and open dialogue.
